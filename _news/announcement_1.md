New website, folks! After a year of having my first jekyll website, I decided to update the layout and content.

I found an absolutely awesome [layout](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and learned some new code, including yaml, html, liquid, and more markdown, of course! Anyway, I hope you like my new website!
