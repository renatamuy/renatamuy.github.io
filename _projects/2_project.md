Science is most powerful when it is understood, and that’s why I am passionate about translating complex disease ecology research into clear, engaging, and impactful narratives. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge scientific discoveries and real-world applications, making information accessible to diverse audiences—from students and researchers to policymakers and the public.

Through educational material development, outreach, and communication, I aim to foster deeper engagement with biodiversity, health, and conservation. By simplifying complexity without losing scientific rigor, I help empower informed decision-making and inspire action toward a more sustainable and resilient future.
